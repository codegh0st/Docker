what is build?
---------------
in build step, we give name of registry, repository and the tag ot the docker daemon, and ask to create image. 
repository is the url where the docker have to connect for any particular image. 
repository is the folder where same app's image is stored in derrent versions.
tag is nothing but one alphanumeric unique identifier for that particular image. because when we pull any iamage we have to specify which
version of that app need to be pulled? that we do in tag.

Note: image is layer based architecture, if we do not specify rgistry url/reposioty then by default
It docker will look for image to hub.docker.com, get the base image of the app which is already
There on docker hub, these images are maintained by docker community.

After fetching this base image we add our app and configure it , we write instruction in 'docker file' what exactly we need . Then we build our own costomized image, 
Later we push this image to any registry (artifact hosting tool like nexus). In this case we are pushing our image to hub.docekr.com. 

Later when we need to run this app in any environment like dev, stage, or prod, we just have to pull that image and run it. 
It will creat one container with all required software and configuration, that app will be running. 

[docker flow]
[app-code + dockerfile] -> [build-image] -> [login and push this iamge-to-registry] 
-> [pull this image to dev/stage/prod env] -> [run-that-iamge-as-container]


Docker only connect with those registry who has SSL/TCL configured. so by default nexus server has no SSL/TCL, in orde to work with docker with
nexus, fist configure SSL TCL. encryption in transit. https protocol.

however its not recommended but we can configure docker daemon to work with insecure connection also by configuring /var/lib/docker/daemon.json file.

/etc/docker/daemon.json
sud vi /etc/docker/daemon.json --> create this file, make this entry in this file for insecure acces. this is nexus ip:port
{
"insecure-registries":["43.205.110.218:8081"]
}

docker run -d --name nginxcontianer -p 80:80 nqinx:<tag>

docker run -d --name tomcatcontianer -p 8080:8080 tomcat  --> if tag is not provide bydefault take 'latest' tag
